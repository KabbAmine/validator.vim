Linter
======

Syntax checker for vim in python.


Requirements
------------

Your vim should be compiled with `python` or `python3`.

Linter relies on external syntax checkers, so you need to install the checkers
fit for the files you are editting.


Install
-------

I recommend to use a plugin manager for installing.

If you use [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim)

    NeoBundle 'maralla/vim-linter'
